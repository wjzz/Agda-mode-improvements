********************************************************************
*  Agda-mode improvements changes since 0.1 (first announcements)  *
********************************************************************

* lemma databases
  - [BUGFIX] additional space before '-}' a db declaration no longer needed

  - [NEW]    C-c C-x C-s displays the contents of all dbs at the current point,
             C-u C-c C-x C-s displays the contents of all dbs at the current point 
               along with type signatures (needs a patched agda-mode)

  - (this was present before, but wasn't documented) newlines are allowed in the
    db declarations, only the '{- BASE' part can't have more than 1 space

* convenient with expressions adding
  - [BUGFIX/NEW] calling C-c C-w on an empty/whitespace only goal doesn't insert
                 an empty with, ask for an expression instead (similar to C-c C-c)

  - [BUGFIX]     better support for generating non-clashing names that name the
                 results of with expressions

* [NEW] generating function body based on type signature

* [NEW] deleting a broken pattern declaration and inserting '... | '
