* lemma databases
  - [BUGFIX] additional space before '-}' a db declaration no longer needed

  - [NEW]    C-c C-x C-s displays the contents of all dbs at the current point,
             C-u C-c C-x C-s displays the contents of all dbs at the current point 
               along with type signatures (needs a patched Agda-2-2-10)

  - [NEW] dbs importing to the current module is now possible. The supported syntax is:

    1) {- BASE IMPORT module-name -}                        # copies all dbs from module-name into current module

    2) {- BASE IMPORT module-name base1 base2 ... basen -}  # copies dbs named base1 .. basen from module-name

    3) {- BASE IMPORT module-name INTO base -}              # copies all dbs from module-name to a single db called base 

    4) variants 2 & 3 can be combined as
       {- BASE IMPORT module-name base1 ... basen INTO final-base -}

  - (this was present before, but wasn't documented) newlines are allowed in the
    db declarations, only the '{- BASE' part can't have more than 1 space

* convenient with expressions adding
  - [BUGFIX/NEW] calling C-c C-w on an empty/whitespace only goal doesn't insert
                 an empty with, ask for an expression instead (similar to C-c C-c)

  - [BUGFIX]     better support for generating non-clashing names that name the
                 results of with expressions

* [NEW] generating function body based on type signature

* [NEW] deleting a broken pattern declaration and inserting '... | '
