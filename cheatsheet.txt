A [G] annotation means that the given command works only inside goals


** theorem databases **

C-c C-v         -- [G] invoke auto with the contents of the given databases (if none given the uses the db named 'global')
C-c C-x C-s     -- shows the contents of all DBs in the mini-buffer
C-u C-c C-x C-s -- shows the contents of all DBs in the mini-buffer along with types (needs an patched agda)

** creating with expressions from goal **

C-c C-w         -- [G] create with expression with ... as LHS
C-u C-c C-w     -- [G] create with expression with LHS repeated from current line
C-x C-c C-w     -- [G] create with expression and perform case analysis on the first 

** minor stuff **

C-c C-x C-f     -- replace the LHS with '...' (useful for situations where Agda messes up the patterns)

C-C g           -- generate the LHS of a function based on the signature (which should end above the current line)

TAB / Shift TAB -- indent/unindent a marked region
